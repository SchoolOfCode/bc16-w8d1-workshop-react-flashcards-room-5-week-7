Flashcards App

Plan:

1. Choose Vite or Next.js and explain why
2. Review broken down app and note what we will use within each section
   - App: All of the components
     - Header: Icon, title, subheading, just CSS âœ…
     - Form: Question field, answer field, add button, must use useState, add event listeners to the button for submitting info
     - Flashcards: Container for individual cards, object to contain flashcard info which comes from input, array of objects, add to array when new flashcard is created
       - Flashcard: Add event listeners to each card for delete and for showing answers, CSS onClick changes
     - Footer: "Built with React" and logo
3. Build section by section
4. Test as we go
5. Once MVP complete, address stretch goals

MVP:

- Look and function the same as Loz's app

Stretch goals:

- Edit existing flashcards
- Add Labels or Categories to Flashcards
- Create a Shuffle Feature
- Implement a Search Function
- Incorporate a Daily Review Limit

Why we chose Vite:
We chose Vite because we didn't need to navigate to any other pages on the app, as it's just a single page app we don't require the complexity of Next.js. We also didn't need to utilise a layout for a single page application.
We haven't used Vite for a week now so it will be a great chance to refresh our skills.
